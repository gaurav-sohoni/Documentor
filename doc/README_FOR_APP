Blocks Documents Upload Application

To setup the application:

1) rake db:create (creates blocks_dev database)

2) rake setup:app (runs rake db:migrate and loads fixtures for setting up initial data)

3) mongrel_rails start (runs app at localhost:3000)

4) Blocks and Categories can be created using the links below the block List table.

5) Blocks and Categories can be deleted directly from the rows and columns resp. There are various
ways in which the application UI can be designed. The current implementation makes the upload easier.
